## 🛠️ How to Run

Each program is written in **C** and can be compiled using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o outputname
./outputname
```

Some programs use **pthreads**:
```bash
gcc thread_based_file.c -lpthread -o program
```

## 💻 Example Projects

- ✅ `scheduling/fcfs/fcfs.c`: First Come First Serve CPU scheduling
- ✅ `ipc/producer_consumer.c`: Synchronization using semaphores
- ✅ `deadlock/bankers_algorithm.c`: Avoid deadlocks using Banker's safety algorithm
